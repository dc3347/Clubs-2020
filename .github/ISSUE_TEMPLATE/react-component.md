## Props and State
Note what props will be coming into the component, and what state it will have. Remember to reference React's [instructions](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-4-identify-where-your-state-should-live) on how to figure out what state/props should be. Aim to make the component as flexible as possible-- we probably should not be hardcoding in content and instead pass it in as props.

**State:**

## Parents and Children
You do not need to list parents and children all the way through the component tree, but it is helpful to know what the direct parent(s) of each component is so that we can get a big-picture understanding of how the data-flow will work in our application. Feel free to link the issues that contain the info about each referenced component as well!

## Styling Notes
While looking at the component in Figma, note any pieces of styling that you might need here by checking out the CSS preview:
``` CSS
/* fonts */
font-family: Roboto;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: 500;

/* colors */
color: #9A9A9A;
background: #FFFFFF;

/* borders and shadows */
border: 2px solid #EC6C52;
border-radius: 5px;
box-shadow: 2px 10px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
```
Remember not to copy any hardcoded positioning and size values.

## Additional Notes
Are there any icons you will need? Images? Written content? Note that here so that we can get it from Product Design before we start!
