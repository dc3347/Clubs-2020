                <p>As a political group that has well-defined values, we look for students who share our values and take our community and work seriously. For this reason, we require an application. To respect everyoneâ€™s time and capacity, our application is short. If your application does not have any major issues, you will be invited to interview with us! Afterwards, we will email you with a decision. We try to be as inclusive as possible; in fact, our club has nearly doubled in size in the last two years. If you think MSA is a good fit for you, apply here: https://googl.form.abcdef12345</p>
